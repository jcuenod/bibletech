# Interacting with Biblical Text

## parabible <https://parabible.com>

This project has received the most attention and most of what I find myself doing now somehow relates to enriching data that this app makes use of. The more data available to parabible, the more it will be able to do. The search function is basic but powerful and the thing I really enjoy about it is how rapidly it can produce results (i.e. in fractions of a second).

## qBible <http://www.qbible.tk>

This was the project that paved the way for parabible. It's for the Old Testament, there are even some tutorial videos on youtube about it...

## theMarker <http://jcuenod.github.io/theMarker/>

This one is a little older and it's for the NT. Doesn't search across different books but it's pretty handy in any case...
