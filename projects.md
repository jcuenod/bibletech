# Interacting with Biblical Text

## qBible <http://www.qbible.tk>

This is definitely the one I'm spending most of my time on right now. It's for the Old Testament, there are even some tutorial videos on youtube about it...

## theMarker <http://jcuenod.github.io/theMarker/>

This one is a little older and it's for the NT. Doesn't search across different books but it's pretty handy in any case...
