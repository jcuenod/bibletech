Just yesterday there was a post over at [bibletech](https://bibleandtech.blogspot.com/) about how to find a Hebrew word only when the LXX translates it with a particular Greek word. Mark Hoffman has a helpful writeup on how to do it on Accordance, Logos and Bibleworks but I've got to say, [Parabible](https://parabible.com/) just makes it look a lot easier. So I thought I'd write up the equivalent method here, especially since I started writing this blog having been inspired by his content.

Before we begin, let's remember that there's no such thing as "The Septuagint" - with that in mind, Parabible's LXX data is not fantastic but it is free. Apparently, I may be using the same alignment data that Bibleworks uses though to get LXX lexemes on Hebrew words - so maybe it's not that bad...

**Step One:** In Parabible, Hebrew words have a bunch of associated morphological data. One of those data points is "Parallel Lexeme". If you click on a word and don't see that field, make sure it's enabled in the `Morphology Settings` in the `Options` menu. So if you're looking for words that the LXX translates with `ἱλάσκομαι`, for example. You might head over to 2 Kings 5:18 and click on `יִסְלַח`. That'll give you something like:

**Step Two:** Click on the `Root` field and the `Parallel Lexeme` field to highlight both of them. Having highlighted both of them, click `Add Search Term` (the big blue button). I've already done that in the picture above.

**Step Three:** Hit `Search` and enjoy the results:
