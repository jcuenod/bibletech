# TLDR

The final product looks like this:

![PDF Full-Text Search using SQLite snippets and GROUP BY](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jcuenod/pdfindex-client/master/demo.gif)

# The Problem

I have a bunch (thousands) of pdfs in my Zotero storage. I want to find places where any of those pdfs mention particular content. But I want searches that are more sophisticated than just 'exact phrase' searches.

# Full Text Search with Sqlite

[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org) is basically one of the most amazing technologies in existence. It's a database in a file and it is great! One of the cool features that it has is call FTS, [full-text search](https://www.sqlite.org/fts5.html).

To create a table that uses Full-Text search, you create a `virtual table`:

```sql
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE EXISTS pdf_content USING fts5(
    id,
    page,
    content
)
```

A `virtual table` is a normal table with special functions; in this case, full-text search (hence `USING fts5`).

With this kind of table, you can run queries like:

```sql
SELECT
  page,
  snippet(pdf_content, 2, '<b>', '</b>', '', 15) as extract
FROM
  pdf_content
WHERE
  content MATCH 'NEAR("search" "terms")'
```

The snippet function is a bit opaque but it's signature is:

- `pdf_content`: Name of the table
- `2`: Index of the column (zero based)
- `<b>`: String to inject before a matching token
- `</b>`: String to inject after a matching token
- `''`: String to inject at beginning and end of string if there is not a matching token there
- `15`: Number of tokens to return (i.e. length of snippet)

# Grabbing Text out of PDFs

The next problem is how to get all the text into the database. I have all my zotero PDFs in `~/Zotero/storage/` but how can I pull text out of them?

I decided to use node because I'm proficient and figured I could make it work fast (but there are CLI tools that I considered using). The solution I got working the quickest was to use the legacy build of `pdfjs-dist`:

```js
const pdfjsLib = require("./node_modules/pdfjs-dist/legacy/build/pdf")

async function getPdfText(path) {
    let doc = await pdfjsLib.getDocument(path).promise
    const pageText = []
    for (let i = 0; i < doc.numPages; i++) {
        const page = await doc.getPage(i + 1)
        const content = await page.getTextContent()
        let output = content.items.map(item => {
            return item.str
        }).join(" ")
        pageText.push(output)
    }
    return pageText.map(page => page.trim())
}
module.exports = { getPdfText }
```

As you can see, a combination of `doc.getPage()` and `page.getTextContent()` gets the content of each page. The `getPdfText` function returns a (promise) array of content. Each page is an element in the array.

The combination of an FTS table in SQLite and this PDF-text-extractor can be found at `https://github.com/jcuenod/pdfindex-create-index/`. This repo also builds a metadata table that stores the name, size, and path of the pdf (so that I can, in theory, tell if I've already indexed it and just skip over it).

# Querying

The query above works great on this table. With the metadata table that I generated in my indexing, the query that I use is:

```sql
SELECT
    metadata.rowid as rowid,
    name,
    page,
    snippet(pages, 2, '<b>', '</b>', '', 15) as extract
  FROM
    pages,
    metadata
  WHERE
    content MATCH 'NEAR("search" "terms")'
  AND
    pages.id = metadata.rowid) fts
```

This query works like a charm but I very quickly found that some pdfs were *full* of matches and that made the results pretty noisy. So I wanted to `GROUP BY` pdf. Something like this:

```sql
SELECT 
  name,
  group_concat(page, ', ') as pages,
  group_concat(extract, '___SEPARATOR___') as extracts
FROM (
  SELECT
    metadata.rowid as rowid,
    name,
    page,
    snippet(pages, 2, '<b>', '</b>', '', 15) as extract
  FROM
    pages,
    metadata
  WHERE
    content MATCH 'NEAR("search" "terms")'
  AND
    pages.id = metadata.rowid) fts
GROUP BY rowid
```

The inner query here is identical to the one above. All that I'm doing is trying to `GROUP BY rowid` (rowid is a hidden column that SQLite automatically adds as a `PRIMARY KEY` to your tables [with some exceptions]). Grouping by `rowid` means a pdf will never show up in the results more than once. This obviously suppresses the prominence of PDFs that have tons of matches but it also surfaces more interesting results because I probably already knew about the ones with tons of matches.

If I run the query above with only `SELECT name FROM ...` (and drop the `group_concat` lines from the `SELECT`), it works as expected. I can add in the `group_concat` for pages and the query continues working. Now it produces a comma separated list of matching page numbers. The last step is to get my snippet/extract back (which was working in the previous query). But when I run it with `group_concat(extract ...` I get:

>Error: unable to use function snippet in the requested context

The same error results using a CTE instead of a subquery.

*bang head against wall for a while* ... solution!

It turns out that SQLite does ["subquery flattening"](https://www.sqlite.org/optoverview.html#subquery_flattening).

>When a subquery occurs in the FROM clause of a SELECT, the simplest behavior is to evaluate the subquery into a transient table, then run the outer SELECT against the transient table. Such a plan can be suboptimal since the transient table will not have any indexes and the outer query (which is likely a join) will be forced to do a full table scan on the transient table.
>
>To overcome this problem, SQLite attempts to flatten subqueries in the FROM clause of a SELECT. This involves inserting the FROM clause of the subquery into the FROM clause of the outer query and rewriting expressions in the outer query that refer to the result set of the subquery. For example:
>
>  `SELECT t1.a, t2.b FROM t2, (SELECT x+y AS a FROM t1 WHERE z<100) WHERE a>5`
>
>Would be rewritten using query flattening as:
>
>  `SELECT t1.x+t1.y AS a, t2.b FROM t2, t1 WHERE z<100 AND a>5`

So SQLite is optimizing my use of a CTE etc. into the same basic query and ripping the `snippet` function out of its nested context. The solution is [annoyingly simple](https://www.mail-archive.com/sqlite-users@mailinglists.sqlite.org/msg115821.html). Force the inner query to materialize results so that it can't be flattened. This can be accomplished by adding:

```sql
LIMIT -1 OFFSET 0
```

The final working query is:

```sql
SELECT 
  name,
  group_concat(page, ', ') as pages,
  group_concat(extract, '___SEPARATOR___') as extracts
FROM (
  SELECT
    metadata.rowid as rowid,
    name,
    page,
    snippet(pages, 2, '<b>', '</b>', '', 15) as extract
  FROM
    pages,
    metadata
  WHERE
    content MATCH 'NEAR("search" "terms")'
  AND
    pages.id = metadata.rowid
  LIMIT -1 OFFSET 0) fts
GROUP BY rowid
ORDER BY name
LIMIT 100;
```

Part of the frustration with this problem is that neither `highlight` nor `snippet` seem to be used with `GROUP BY` very often so googling did not produce many results and it took me a while to realize that I should expand my search to include the `highlight` function because it is doing something pretty similar to `snippet` (and I tested and realized it also didn't work).

# Finishing it Off

The final step is to make an interface that doesn't require this cumbersome query to get a set of results and that doesn't force me to visually grep the results in a terminal. Thus, sprinkle some express magic and you have a server that responds to `/query?q=search terms` (which is now [here](https://github.com/jcuenod/pdfindex-server)) and then sprinkle some react magic and you have a client that debounces requests and produces results on the fly ([here](https://github.com/jcuenod/pdfindex-client)). At this point, after pointing the server to our SQLite index and the client to our server, we are back at the TLDR...
