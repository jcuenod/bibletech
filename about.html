Hi there! My name is [James Cu√©nod](https://jcuenod.github.io/) and you have found what basically amounts to my quick 'n dirty notes to myself. I have two basic interests: *biblical studies* (especially the Old Testament) and *software development*. Those collide in [parabible.com](https://parabible.com) (more on that later).

Currently I am a PhD student at Wheaton College studying **Old Testament** where I intend to write about **Sabbath Theology**. But I've been using Linux since before I can remember and writing software since before that (in the good ol' days of QBasic).

I do an embarrassing amount of hobbyist programming - embarrassing because, given the quantity, one would expect the quality to be somewhat superior. Nevertheless, if you are interested in that you can see more about my software adventures [here](http://github.com/jcuenod/). Right now my pride and joy is [parabible.com](https://parabible.com). Check it out. No seriously. If you don't know Hebrew or Greek, well it'll be less useful (but you can enable parallel texts from the menu). Basically, parabible is a tool that has transformed the way I do Old Testament studies by faciliating pretty sophisticated searches by letting users build searches based on morphological data quickly and easily (to understand a bit more of that, take a look at the gifs posted on http://twitter.com/parabible).

If you have any questions or want to hunt me down for some reason (other than malice), please feel free to make contact (but use some method other than the contact page here, I couldn't be bothered to hook it up to an actual backend at this point).
