Hi there! My name is [James Cuénod](https://jcuenod.github.io/) and you have found what basically amounts to my quick 'n dirty notes to myself. I have two basic interests: *biblical studies* (especially the Old Testament) and *software development*. In 2017, my interest in software led me to begin exploring ML and I've worked on a number NLP-related projects since then (before the inimitable ChatGPT).

Currently I am the **Senior AI Translation Technologist** at Seed Company. I moved to Seed Co from Clear Bible/Biblica. Before that I did a PhD at Wheaton College, IL studying **Old Testament** where I wrote on **Sabbath Theology**.

I have a number of [software projects](https://github.com/jcuenod) that cycle through periods of activity. Two that are in production and have daily active users are:

* https://parabible.com
* https://fixpdfs.com

If you have any questions or want to hunt me down for some reason (other than malice), please feel free to make contact.
